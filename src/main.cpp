//You will input whatever motor names you chose when you configured your robot using the sidebar configurer, they don't have to be "Motor1" and "Motor2".

//Left Motors:
pros::MotorGroup({4,5,6}),

//Right Motors:
pros::MotorGroup({8,9,10}),

//Specify the PORT NUMBER of your inertial sensor, in number form:
1,

//Input your wheel diameter. (4" omnis are actually closer to 4.125"):
3.25,

//External ratio, must be in decimal, in the format of input teeth/output teeth.
//If your motor has an 84-tooth gear and your wheel has a 60-tooth gear, this value will be 1.4.
//If the motor drives the wheel directly, this value is 1:
0.6,

//Gyro scale, this is what your gyro reads when you spin the robot 360 degrees.
//For most cases 360 will do fine here, but this scale factor can be very helpful when precision is necessary.
